# 🧱 2D Grid-Based Trun-Based Dungeon Game (Unity)

A 2D grid-based turn-based strategy game made with Unity. Inspired by classic tactics games and dungeon crawlers, this project features:

- Turn-based unit movement
- A tile-based grid system

This game is in early development and intended as both a learning project and a foundation for future gameplay systems (like AI, abilities, fog of war, etc).
